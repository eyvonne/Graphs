unvisited is a set of all rooms
while unvisited not empty:
	get start
	go until all exits visited using dfs
		pop out of unvisited as we go
	do a bfs to find the nearest unvisited exit
	traverse to there 
	start over


if I were to shoot for stretch: 
from each point with multiple exits, do a dft to find the exits the long way
go down the longest path
if stuck, reverse.
