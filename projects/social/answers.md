1. to create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each on average you would have to call add_friendship 500 times. This is interesting because I would have expected double

2. impressively theres about a 99.5% connection in the graph with only five friends. there is an average of around 5 degrees of separation from anyone. I'm curious if this has to do with the average number of friends also being five. I'll do some testing and report back.

Nope not directly related. If I thought about that for two seconds I probably could have figured that out- more friends, less degrees of separation. Five is just the magic balance point
